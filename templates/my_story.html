	  <p class="paragraph">Hello, my name is Michael Kobayashi.  I am the founder and Japanese-to-English translator for browser-beijin.com</p>
	  <p class="paragraph">I was born in California, graduated university in America with a degree in English teaching, and came to Japan in 2009.</p>
	  <p class="paragraph">In 2019, I founded browser-beijin.com.  Why does the world need yet one more translation-services company, you might ask?  Read on below, and you will discover that browser-beijin serves a special niche not catered to by any other currently existing translation company.</p>

	  <h2 class="heading-1">The Three Reasons for Browser-beijin:</h2>
	  <h2 class="heading-1">Reason 1: Eikaiwa is an overkill (sometimes)!</h2>
	  <p class="paragraph">When I came to Japan in 2001 and began teaching English, many of my students were studying "Business English." There were a handful of them who actually needed speaking proficiency for things like telephone conferences and business trips abroad.  However, I noticed that a large number of the students would often bring in English documents for checking or translation:</p>
	  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/eikaiwa_english.jpg')}}">
	  <p class="paragraph">Eikaiwa was clearly an overkill for many students.  They were paying nearly <span style="color:red"> 5,000 yen for 40-minutes of English "conversation,"</span> then actually using only a few minutes of the classtime for English writing correction.</p>
	  <p class="paragraph"><center><b>I thought, "Isn't there a better option for these kind of people--who simply want their English documents corrected?"</b></center>
        <div class="rule rule-2">
          <hr>
        </div>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h2 class="heading-1">Reason 2: Writing email is hard!</h2>
	  <p class="paragraph">After many years in the teaching industry, I wanted to move into translating.  As I began to search for jobs, I received some job offers.  Hence, I was faced with the necessity of writing response emails in Japanese.  In doing so, I found I had a lot of questions about the subtle differences in Japanese phrases, and often did not know the most natural way to say something:
	  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/email_english.jpg')}}">
	  <p class="paragraph">I had no way to know the nuance of various phrases without asking a native speaker.  It troubled me that <span style="color:red">I could not write an email confidently</span>.
	  <p class="paragraph"><center><b>I thought, "Is there not an option in this situation--when you are writing an email in a foreign language, and simply have a question about which phrase is most suitable?"</b></center>
        <div class="rule rule-2">
          <hr>
        </div>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h2 class="heading-1">Reason 3: Translating 1 or 2 sentences is expensive!</h2>	  
	  <p class="paragraph">Finally, when I began working in the translation industry, I came face-to-face with the realities of tight deadlines and extreme "minimum charges" for translation.  We did most of the translation in-house, but sometimes needed to subcontract to another translation company.  Many times, the company needed just a sentence or two translated, on a tight schedule, and I was surprised at the lack of affordable, quick options:</p>
	  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/honyaku_english.jpg')}}">
	  <p class="paragraph">I saw money flying out the door of the company for such small-scale translation projects.  <span style="color:red">In addition to the cost being high, the time necessary was often long</span>--even for just one sentence or two.
	  <p class="paragraph"><center><b>I thought, "Isn't there a faster, cheaper option for companies that only need a handful of words translated or checked?"</b></center>
        <div class="rule rule-2">

	  <ol type="1">
      <lh><h2 class="heading-2">In summary, 3 things...</h2></lh>
      <li>Cheap & convenient English document correction.</li>
      <li>Fast & reliable advice for writing emails.</li>
      <li>Affordable small-scale translation for companies, with a quick turnaround.</li>
  	  </ol>
	  <p class="paragraph">These are the 3 things that browser-beijin.com offers.  If <b>you</b> are 1) using eikaiwa as a document-correction service, 2) struggling with the nuances of English emailing, or 3) tired of the minimum charges & slow response time of big translation companies, I urge you to give browser-beijin a try!</p>
